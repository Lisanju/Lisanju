# Welcome to my profile 🐝
I'm a BSc Linguistics student at UFSCar - Brazil. I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of natural languages and natural language processing (NLP). My projects involve theoretical linguistics, formal logic, computational implementation of language models and NLP-oriented data.

## Formal Semantics
After all, what is formal semantics?

Formal semantics is a field of theoretical linguistics which provides mathematical formalizations for the meaning of natural language expressions.
I like studying topics related to (anti-)comitativity (such as comitatives modifiers, like 'alone' and 'sozinho') and expressive meanings (such as honorifics and slurs, like 'いらっしゃる' and 'pra caralho').

The theory of formal semantics can be implemented computationally, which means that the theory can also be expressed as running code rather than just mathematical formalizations.

## Natural Language Processing
Regarding NLP, I'm studying the (semi-)automatic production of linguistics resources like mono-bi-tri-lingual dictionaries and concept-based glossaries / WordNet databases.

Being interested in symbolic paradigms of language processing, I often practice implementing natural language generation rules in Prolog.

### Current projects:
- Geoki Jiten, a bilingual brazilian portuguese and okinawan dictionary.
