I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of (anti-)comitativity and expressive meanings, such as comitatives, exclusives, honorifics and cussing words. Regarding NLP, I'm studying the lexicographical building of mono-bi-tri-lingual dictionaries and concept-based lexical glossaries / wordnet databases.
