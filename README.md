I'm a BSc Linguistics student at UFSCar - Brazil. I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of natural languages and natural language processing (NLP). My projects involve theoretical linguistics, formal logic, computational implementation of language models and NLP-oriented datasets.

### Formal Semantics
I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of (anti-)comitativity and expressive meanings, such as comitatives and exclusives modifiers, honorifics and cussing words. Regarding NLP, I'm studying the lexicographical building of mono-bi-tri-lingual dictionaries and concept-based lexical glossaries / wordnet databases.

### Current projects:
- Geoki Jiten, a bilingual brazilian portuguese and okinawan dictionary;
