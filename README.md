# Welcome to my profile 🐝
I'm a BSc Linguistics student at UFSCar - Brazil. I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of natural languages and natural language processing (NLP). My projects involve theoretical linguistics, formal logic, computational implementation of language models and NLP-oriented datasets.

### Formal Semantics
After all, what is formal semantics?

Formal semantics is a field of theoretical linguistics which provides mathematical formalizations about the meaning of natural language expressions.
I like studying topics related to (anti-)comitativity (such as comitatives and exclusives modifiers, like 'alone' and 'só') and expressive meanings (such as honorifics and slurs, like 'いらっしゃる' and 'pra caralho').

### Current projects:
- Geoki Jiten, a bilingual brazilian portuguese and okinawan dictionary;
