# Welcome to my profile 🐝
I'm a BSc Linguistics student at UFSCar - Brazil. I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of natural languages and natural language processing (NLP). My projects involve theoretical linguistics, formal logic, computational implementation of language models and NLP-oriented datasets.

### Formal Semantics
After all, what is formal semantics?

Formal semantics is a field of theoretical linguistics which provides mathematical formalizations about the meaning of natural language expressions.
I like studying topics related to (anti-)comitativity (such as comitatives and exclusives modifiers, like 'alone' and 'só') and expressive meanings (such as honorifics and slurs, like 'いらっしゃる' and 'pra caralho').

The theory of linguistic semantics can be implemented computationally, which means that the theory can also be expressed as running code (rather than just mathematical formalizations).

### Current projects:
- Geoki Jiten, a bilingual brazilian portuguese and okinawan dictionary;
