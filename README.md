# Welcome to my profile üêù
Hello! I'm Elisa Anju Lardapide, a brazilian romani and BSc Linguistics student. =)

I'm interested mainly in the formal semantics of natural languages and natural language processing (NLP). My projects involve theoretical linguistics, formal logic and NLP-oriented data.

## Formal Semantics
After all, what is formal semantics?

Formal semantics is a field of theoretical linguistics which provides mathematical formalizations for the meaning of natural language expressions.
I like studying topics related to (anti-)comitativity (such as comitatives modifiers, like 'alone' and 'sozinho') and expressive meanings (such as honorifics and slurs, like '„ÅÑ„Çâ„Å£„Åó„ÇÉ„Çã' and 'pra caralho').

The theory of formal semantics can be implemented computationally, which means that the theory can also be expressed as running code rather than just mathematical formalizations.

## Natural Language Processing
Regarding NLP, I'm studying the (semi-)automatic production of linguistics resources like mono-bi-tri-lingual dictionaries and concept-based glossaries / WordNet databases.

### Current projects:
- Geoki Jiten, a bilingual brazilian portuguese and okinawan dictionary;
- Romani DT, a data resource of romani language expressions.
