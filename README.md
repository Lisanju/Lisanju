## Formal Semantics
After all, what is formal semantics?

Formal semantics is a field of theoretical linguistics which provides mathematical formalizations for the meaning of natural language expressions.
I like studying topics related to (anti-)comitativity (such as comitative modifiers, like 'sem' and 'sozinho') and expressive meanings (such as honorifics and slurs, like 'いらっしゃる' and 'pra caralho').
